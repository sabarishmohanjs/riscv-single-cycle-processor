# ðŸš€ RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor Implementation

Welcome to the RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor project!  
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a basic RISC-V processor designed to execute instructions in a single clock cycle. Ideal for learning core computer architecture concepts .

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Implementation of core RISC-V RV32I instructions.
- Integration of ALU, Control Unit, Register File, Data & Instruction Memory.
- Simulation-based functional verification using testbenches.
- Simple yet powerful architecture enabling quick instruction execution.

---

## ðŸ§± Key Features

- Program Counter (PC) and instruction fetch logic.
- Immediate Generator and ALU Control.
- Data Memory with read/write capabilities.
- Branch and Jump instruction handling.
- Single-cycle datapath architecture.
- Testbench for simulation verification.

---

## âš¡ Example Program

A simple RISC-V assembly program is included that computes the sum of the first 10 natural numbers using a loop.
